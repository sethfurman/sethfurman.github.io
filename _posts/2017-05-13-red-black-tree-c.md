Overview
--------
As part of my systems programming course, I completed a project that had us
implement a dynamic memory allocation library in C. Our library would manage a
given block of memory (a heap) with analogs of the standard library functions
`malloc`, `realloc`, and `free` named (respectively) `hl_alloc`, `hl_resize`,
and `hl_release`.

To make our implementation time-efficent (and for fun) I decided to implement a
Red-Black Tree (RBT), which would be used as follows:
- Each RBT node is the header of a block of memory (managed by a heap).
- Nodes (i.e. blocks) that are in the tree are implicitly free, while those not
  in the tree are implicitly in use.
- A heap's RBT is sorted by block capacity.

With this setup, we can fulfill memory allocation requests by removing the
smallest node of (at least) the requested size and returning a pointer to the
start of its block. Blocks would likewise be freed by coalescing them with
adjacent free blocks and adding them to the tree.
- Note that we can reduce the amount of unused memory generated by allocation
  requests by cleaving excess memory off of the end of a removed node, forming
  it into a new node, and re-adding it to the tree.

RBT Implementation
------------------
Below is the header file for my Red-Black Tree implementation, which defines
the interface. As mentioned below, the actual implementation was based on
[Professor Lyn Turbak's "Red-Black Trees" handout][turbak-rbt.pdf],
while `RBT_pretty_print` was based on an [implementation][tree-pretty-print]
written by [VasyaNovikov][vasyanovikov] (which was "inspired by the 'tree'
command in linux").

To see my full implementation and tests (which should run on either Mac OS X or
Linux) check out the GitHub repository
