## What is Accolade?
I spent this past summer (2017) interning at a company called Accolade.

Accolade is a self-described "healthcare concierge," meaning that they provide
services to help people navigate the complexities of the healthcare system.
They do this largely with "health assistants," employees trained to take calls
where they answer questions and provide guidance.

Accolade's services improve the experiences and outcomes of those consuming
healthcare and save money for their employers by helping users the right care
and advice when they need it.

This includes: helping them find doctors and schedule appointments, answering
questions about coverage and benefits, understanding bills and claims, and so
on. For instance, we interns listened to a sample phone call where a health
assistant stayed helped one woman get her children onto her health insurance
plan.

One thing Accolade isn't is a call center. Every time you call you get the same
person and your designated health assistant is free to talk for as long as you
need.

As of now Accolade serves relatively big customers like Lowe's, Comcast, and
the Temple University Health System though they hope to serve smaller companies
in the future.

## What did I do?
Over the course of my 10 weeks at Accolade (6/12/2017 - 8/17/2017) I worked as
a software developer intern on the "identity" team, known officially as Dragon
Team.

Dragon is responsible for Accolade's API Gateway (the interface to the
company's web APIs/services) as well as identity-related web services used for
things such as user and employee authentication and authorization: "who's who
and what can they do."

Within Dragon, my job was nebulous. I was a member of the team, and worked on
items in the backlog that a regular team member would do -- provided I had the
know-how and it wasn't something that could blow up one of their development
environments (like manually entering data into a database). This included tasks
related to user provisioning (automating the process of granting access to
users) and refactoring code in various microservices in Accolade's API cloud
platform. I also tested and gave feedback on the work of others on my team and
wrote some API documentation.

Aside from that I gained new experience with [Scrum][scrum]: Accolade's
software development framework of choice. Over the course of a handful of
2-week sprints, I participated in daily [stand-ups][stand_up], regular [backlog
grooming][grooming], and wrote several [user stories][user_stories]. I also
took part in [planning][planning] and [retrospective][retro] meetings every
sprint, team powwows for estimating work at the start of the sprint and
evaluating our performance at the end.

## My experience
Overall, the team and everyone else at Accolade were friendly and welcoming
across departments and job titles. The open office layout also made for a
close-knit experience with coworkers that encouraged collaboration and created
an atmosphere of respect and equality.
