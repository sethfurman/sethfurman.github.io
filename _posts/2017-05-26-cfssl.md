Overview
--------
During the Spring 2017 semester (February to April) I took a course called
"Open-Source Software Engineering," a class where students spend the semester
contributing to an existing open-source project.

I chose to work on the CFSSL team, which worked on improving one of
[Cloudflare's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare) command line tools
by providing support for "Certificate Transparency," an added layer of security
being gradually phased into the existing web infrastructure.

Below is a picture of our team: (left-to-right) myself, Bradley Tiller, Jimmy
Cao, and David Li.

about the purpose of CFSSL or the [CFSSL GitHub repository][cfssl-repo].

<h3>Why does this course exist?</h3>
Each team had mentors, actively contributing members of their chosen project,
who got them up to speed on contributing and helped focus their efforts. While
most of the projects started with some specific goal, students had some freedom
to choose their specific tasks (such as addressing an issue filed by a user or
another contributor). One of the main goals of the course was to develop the
practical skills needed to understand and contribute to an existing software
project. For instance, we spent a lot of time reading code, issues, and outside
resources to better understand our tasks and develop reasonable implementations
that were consistent with the existing codebase (without breaking it).

The Project and Our Contributions
-------------
<h3>What is CFSSL?</h3>
Every time you visit a website, just before connecting, your browser checks
that you're visiting the correct site (and not an imposter) by inspecting an
*SSL certificate* provided by the site's server. Each certificate is like a
public ID card that contains identifying information for the site and a secure
*signature* that uniquely identifies its issuer. The signature enables
authentication because your browser only trusts certificates signed and issued
by trusted organizations called Certificate Authorities (CAs).
[*Cloudflare SSL* (CFSSL)][cfssl-repo] is an open-source command line tool
created by Cloudflare for creating and managing SSL certificates.

<h3>What is Certificate Transparency?</h3>
One problem with authenticating websites with certificates is that it relies
heavily on trust in Certificate Authorities. CAs can be compromised by hackers
or simply behave maliciously (e.g. by issuing a certificate for your website to
a third party). This creates the need to quickly detect maliciously issued
certificates. [*Certificate Transparency* (CT)][ct.org] is a framework that was
developed to address this problem by enabling users, website owners, and
certificate authorities to monitor the status of all certificates. One main
feature introduced by Certificate Transparency is the certificate log server.
In CT, all certificates must be submitted to public "CT Log" servers that keep
an append-only collection of issued certificates.  Browsers would only trust
certificates that are available in one of these public logs, and CAs and domain
owners would regularly check these logs for suspicious certificates. This
allows users and website owners to quickly distrust certificates and detect
when new certificates have been issued for existing websites, which together
make them less vulnerable to compromised CAs.

<h3>What did I work on?</h3>
Whenever a certificate is submitted to a log, the log returns a Signed
Certificate Timestamp (SCT), which websites must provide with the certificate
before establishing a connection to a client. Because CAs are responsible for
submitting certificates to logs, they must also provide SCTs to website owners.
There are multiple ways of transmitting SCTs to website owners, one of which
involves embedding them inside the actual certificates. This, however, requires
that CAs wait to receive SCTs from logs before they issue the corresponding
certificates. Another, faster, method involves embedding (a.k.a. "stapling")
the SCTs in the response from a separate server. Then, when the SCT becomes
available, the website owner can contact the server and extract the embedded
SCT. My main contribution to CFSSL was to enable the second, "stapling"
approach. To do this, I created a section in a database for storing SCTs, which
would be updated when new SCTs are received. Then, I augmented a second
database section that stores precomputed server responses. I had this second
database section check for SCTs in the SCT database section and "staple" them
to the new responses. Thus, new SCTs are eventually added to the server's
responses, making them available to website owners. This contributed to the
adoption of the CT framework within CFSSL by enabling an alternative method of
SCT issuance.

<h4>StapleSCTList</h4>
Below is the signature of one of the main functions I contributed to enable
"stapling" SCTs to OCSP responses.

```go
// StapleSCTList inserts a list of Signed Certificate Timestamps into all OCSP
// responses in a database.
func StapleSCTList(acc certdb.Accessor, serial, aki string, scts []ct.SignedCertificateTimestamp,
	responderCert, issuer *x509.Certificate, priv crypto.Signer) error {
        ...
}
```
